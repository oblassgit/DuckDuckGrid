## Notable features I implemented
- Saving "liked" state of an image in SharedPreferences
- pinching to change collumn count in the Grid- and LikedFragment
- Bottom navigation using nav graph
- getting random duck images from https://random-d.uk/api/v2/random and displaying them
- Showing all "liked" images in LikedFragment

## Dependencies
- https://random-d.uk/api/v2/random for getting random duck Images
